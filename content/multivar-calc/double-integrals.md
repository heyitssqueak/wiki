## what is a double integral?
A double integral is an integral over two variables. Instead of *area* under the curve, a double integral produces *volume* under a surface. Whereas a single integral integrates over a two-dimensional curve (think a line defined by $x$ and $y$), a double integral will integrate under a three-dimensional *surface* (like a plane defined by $x$, $y$, and $z$). This surface — our region of integration — is denoted by $R$.
> $$\iint\limits_{R} f(x,y) dy dx$$  

The integration over $x$ and $y$ produces a surface (which we've called $R$). This means that the notation $dy dx$ can be simplified to $dA$, as integration over these two variables is equal to integration over their area. This produces the standard formula for a double integral.
> $$\iint\limits_{R} f(x,y) dA$$

-> double integrals can find AREA too (with upper and lower bound as FUNCTIONS)

## how do we evaluate a double integral?
A double integral can be broken down into an iterated integral, where we can evaluate from the inside integral expanding outwards. To change the double integral into an iterated integral, bounds need to be assigned.

## double integrals over rectangles
- talk about how to assign bounds
- double integral over general regions
- double integral over polar regions



- can be expressed as an iterated integral which can be expressed as two single integrals. Similar to how we evaluate partial derivatives by *deriving* with respect to one variable at a time, we can also evaluate double integrals by *integrating* with respect to one variable at a time.

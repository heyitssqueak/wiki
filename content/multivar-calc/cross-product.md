title: Cross Product

## what is the cross product?
The cross product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal length vectors and returns a vector (opposed to the [dot product](/multivar-calc/dot-product.md), which returns a single number also called a scalar). The resulting answer is the vector perpendicular to the two crossed vectors.

There are two ways to solve for the cross product â€” find the determinant of a 3x3 matrix
> $$\text{det}\begin{bmatrix}\hat{\textbf{i}} & \hat{\textbf{j}} & \hat{\textbf{k}}\\ a_1 & a_2 & a_3\\ b_1 &b_2&b_3 \end{bmatrix}$$

or use the formula
> $$\textbf{a}\times\textbf{b}=||\textbf{a}||\space||\textbf{b}||\sin\theta\space\textbf{n}$$

## magnitude of a cross product
Given two vectors, we can find the area of the parallelogram that they form by taking the magnitude of their cross product.
> $$||\textbf{a}\times\textbf{b}||=||\textbf{a}||\space||\textbf{b}|||\sin\theta|$$

## what are spherical coordinates?
Spherical coordinates are one way to define a set of points in space, similar to [cartesian coordinates](/multivar-calc/cartesian-coordinates.md) or polar coordinates. The difference between spherical coordinates and the two aforementioned systems is that spherical coordinates are primarily used in three-dimensional space. Each point in space is defined by three numbers: $\rho$ denoting radial distance, $\theta$ denoting angle with respect to the $x$ and $y$ axes, and $\phi$ denoting angle with respect to the $z$ axis. There are many other conventions commonly used for ($\rho$, $\theta$, $\phi$) including some of which where the meanings are switched around â€” I will be using these symbols in the way that I have defined previously.

 Symbol | Meaning | Other Names
 ------------ | ----- | ---- 
$\rho$ | distance from the origin | radial distance
$\theta$ | angle with respect to $x$ and $y$ axis; think unit circle | azimuth angle
$\phi$ | angle with respect to the $z$ axis | zenith angle; polar angle

## defining spherical coordinates in terms of other coordinate systems
$$\rho=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$$

## what is a triple integral?
A triple integral is an integral over three variables. Whereas a [double integral](/multivar-calc/double-integrals.md) can find volume or area, a triple integral can only find *volume* (and is sometimes used to find density).

A surface will be defined by two variables (like $x$, $y$ or $r$, $\theta$) and then a third variable (like $z$) **brings it togehter**. Since our region of integration is a three-dimensional shape, it can be denoted by $E$.

> $$\iiint\limits_{E} f(x,y,z)\,dz\,dy\,dx$$

## triple integrals over boxes
A triple integral over the volume of a cube or rectangular prism is the simplest example of a triple integral. Given three vectors, the formula for integration is as follows:

> $$B=[a,b]\times[c,d]\times[r,s]=\int_a^b\int_c^d\int_r^sf(x,y,z)\,dz\,dy\,dx$$



<!-- A double integral is an [[integral]] over two [[variables]]. Instead of *area* under the curve, a double integral produces *volume* under a surface. Whereas a single integral integrates over a two-dimensional curve (think a line defined by $x$ and $y$), a double integral will integrate under a three-dimensional *surface* (like a plane defined by $x$, $y$, and $z$). This surface — our region of integration — is denoted by $R$.
$$\iint\limits_{R} f(x,y) \,dy \,dx$$
The integration over $x$ and $y$ produces a surface (which we've called $R$). This means that the notation $dy dx$ can be simplified to $dA$, as integration over these two variables is equal to integration over their area. This produces the standard formula for a double integral.

polar | $x=r\cos\theta$ $y=r\sin\theta$ | usually used for two-dimensional space, but with an added $z$ axis, polar coordinates become cylindrical coordinates and can be used in three-dimensional space 
spherical | $x=\rho\cos\phi\sin\theta$ $y=\rho\sin\phi\sin\theta$ $z=\rho\cos\theta$ | used primarily in three-dimensional space

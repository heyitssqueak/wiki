## Definition

## Matrix-matrix multiplication
### Size
To multiply two matrices together, the number of *columns* of matrix #1 should be equal to the number of *rows* of matrix #2. 

Matrix A is an $m$ by $n$ matrix, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns. Matrix B is an $r$ by $s$ matrix, where $r$ is the number of rows and $s$ is the number of columns. $n$ should be equal to $r$. The product matrix AB has dimensions of $m$ rows and $s$ columns. 

#### Example


### Method
- dot product

When multiplying two matrices, take the dot product of the $i$th row of matrix A with the $j$th column of matrix B to get the row $i$, column $j$ entry of their product matrix (denoted as $M_{i,j}$).
